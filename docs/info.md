## How it works

The tt_um_dco module is a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) that generates a frequency-adjustable clock signal based on an 8-bit control input (ui_in). The control input determines the oscillation period using a priority-based selection, where the highest active bit sets the period between 3 and 50 clock cycles. A fast clock is derived from the main clock (clk) using a 4-bit divider, toggling every four cycles. A counter increments on each clock edge, and when it reaches the selected period, dco_out toggles, generating the output waveform. The reset (rst_n) initializes the oscillator, and unused outputs are assigned zero to prevent warnings.

## How to test

To verify the functionality of the tt_um_dco module, a testbench (tb) has been provided. The testbench simulates different input scenarios and observes the output behavior of the tt_um_dco module to ensure that it works correctly.

**Inputs and Clock Frequency**

**u_in** is used to receive dco_code.

**rst_n** is the active-low reset signal.

**clk** operates at a 50 MHz frequency.

## External hardware

During the simulation, you can monitor the console or waveform outputs for detailed step-by-step results. The testbench uses $monitor to display real-time updates of the inputs and the resulting output.
